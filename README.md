Ingredients to Recipes

<b>Purpose</b>
<p>There are a plethora of cooking websites that host a bunch of recipes, but finding something to cook with the random ingredients you have can be difficult, especially for people like me who lack confident cooking skills to improvise on the fly.

That is where this website comes in, allowing the user to input a list of ingredients and get a list of recipes that can be created with the ingredients you have on hand.</p>
<br>
<b>Features</b>
<p>The design, functionality, and scope of the website will be subject to change with team members inputs, but the crucial functions of the website that I can identify are as follows:
Searching/Input mechanism that is simple for beginning users with a degree of specificity for advanced users
Saving of particular recipes to a user profile</p>
<br>
<b>Goals</b>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have the website be functional and beautiful enough to be apart of a resume or portfolio</li>
    <li>To have this website hosted on some service, like Amazon AWS or a similar product</li>
    <li>To achieve an A on this project</li></ul></p>
<br>
<b>Other Information</b>
<p>The name of the website is subject to change, itâ€™s the best name I could come up with on the fly.
Based on team member input, we could also make this site an AI that gives a random recipe for a set of ingredients, which would be an interesting direction for this project to go</p>
